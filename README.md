# Fleet SDK Gradle Plugins

The Fleet SDK is a collection of plugins for the Gradle build system to help configuring your environment for building and publishing
plugins for Fleet.

> [!CAUTION]
> ðŸš§ Building Fleet plugins is not yet available publically, this repository is under construction, links and instructions will not work. ðŸš§

## Getting started

1. Use the [Fleet Theme Plugin template][fleet:template-repo] to bootstrap your plugin's repository
2. (optional) Once ready to publish your plugin, follow the [Marketplace Publishing Setup][fleet:marketplace-publishing]
3. (optional) Take a look at [example plugins directory][fleet:example-plugins]
